                <p>I'm Twila, a senior web developer, user experience strategist, and writer with over 20 years of experience working with everyone from large organizations to solo entrepreneurs.
                   I specialize in website audits that help you identify what might be holding your site back whether it's performance, messaging, or the overall experience your customers are having.</p>

                <p>I also offer secret shopper services where I go through your entire customer journey - from first click to checkout - and provide thoughtful, actionable feedback. And if you're a small business managing your own site, I'm here to help you troubleshoot common web issues, no matter what platform you're using.</p>
                <p>My job isn't to sell you a massive redesign package or push you into a new system. It's to use my experience to help you understand your options and move forward with clarity.</p>

                <p>Whether you're dealing with a single frustrating issue or a site that just isn't working the way you hoped, I'll help you find the solution that fits your budget, your comfort level, and your energy.</p>

        <p>
            The Website Glow-Up Plan gives small business owners a professional review of their site. I will go through your site with fresh eyes to help you figure out what's working, what's not, and what to do about it. You'll get a video walkthrough showing you specific recommendations for your site. You'll also get a written report with clear next steps you can actually act on. So if your site's been making you feel stuck, or stressed, or just… exhausted, let's change that. You deserve a site that you love and that actually helps you grow your business. </p>
